This research focuses on developing socially aware robotics using reinforcement learning (RL) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Our goal is to enable robots to understand and respond to social cues, such as gestures, speech, and facial expressions, in a context-sensitive manner.

We implemented Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to optimize decision-making in human-robot interactions. Additionally, we developed a predictive model for sound classification, addressing class imbalance with random oversampling, label simplification, and confidence interval adjustments. These improvements enhanced the model's accuracy and generalization.

Future work includes exploring Bayesian neural networks, SMOTE for data balancing, and real-time learning, aiming to refine socially intelligent robotic behavior.
