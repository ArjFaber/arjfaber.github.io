## 🔍 About Me  

I'm a graduate researcher with a background in econometrics, AI, and reinforcement learning. My work spans deep learning, robotics, and formal verification of algorithms. Currently, I'm researching **formal proof methods for reinforcement learning** at the University of Edinburgh.  

When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing jazz guitar, following Formula 1, or traveling the world!
